Automatic Dental Disease Detection System
# 🦷 Dental Disease Detection System

This project is a machine learning-powered web application that helps identify common dental diseases from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It features a full model training pipeline and a Streamlit-based frontend for predictions.


## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Upload dental images for instant predictions.
- 🤖 Predicts 5 common dental diseases:
  - Caries
  - Gingivitis
  - Hypodontia
  - Mouth Ulcer
  - Tooth Discoloration
- 📊 Visualizes prediction confidence with interactive bar charts.
- ⚠️ Identifies low-confidence or unknown disease cases.
- 🛠️ Train your own model using the included training pipeline.
